#### Debugging improvements

[@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill) spent a lot of time polishing the script debugging experience for this release:

- You can now pass arguments to scripts in the debugger with the `args` parameter in launch.json
- You can also run your script with the 32-bit debugger by changing the `type` parameter in launch.json to "PowerShell x86" (also thanks to [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- The new default PowerShell debugger configuration now launches the active file in the editor
- You can also set the working directory where the script is run by setting the `cwd` parameter in launch.json to an absolute path.  If you need a workspace relative path, use ${workspaceRoot} to create an absolute path e.g. `"${workspaceRoot}/modules/foo.psm1"`.

We recommend deleting any existing `launch.json` file you're using so that a new one will
be generated with the new defaults.

#### Console improvements

- Improved PowerShell console output formatting and performance
  - The console prompt is now displayed after a command is executed
  - Command execution errors are now displayed correctly in more cases
  - Console output now wraps at 120 characters instead of 80 characters

- Added choice and input prompt support
  - When executing code using the 'Run Selection' command, choice and input prompts appear as VS Code UI popups
  - When executing code in the debugger, choice and input prompts appear in the Debug Console

#### New commands

- "Find/Install PowerShell modules from the gallery" (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+F`): Enables you to find and install modules from the PowerShell Gallery (thanks [@dfinke](https://github.com/dfinke)!)
- "Open current file in PowerShell ISE" (`Ctrl+Shift+i`): Opens the current file in the PowerShell ISE (thanks [@janegilring](https://github.com/janegilring)!)

#### Editor improvements

- Path auto-completion lists show just the current directory's contents instead of the full path (which had resulted in clipped text)
- Parameter auto-completion lists are now sorted in the same order as they are in PowerShell ISE where command-specific parameters preceed the common parameters
- Parameter auto-completion lists show the parameter type
- Command auto-completion lists show the resolved command for aliases and the path for executables
- Many improvements to the PowerShell snippets, more clearly separating functional and example snippets (all of the latter are prefixed with `ex-`)
- Added some additional example script files in the `examples` folder

#### New configuration settings

- `powershell.developer.editorServicesLogLevel`: configures the logging verbosity for PowerShell Editor Services.  The default log level will now write less logs, improving overall performance
